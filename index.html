			<h2>Who we are</h2>
			<p>
				The Downeast InterGroup Committee is a group of Alcoholics Anonymous members coming together in the spirit of fellowship 
				to help carry the AA message by publishing a newsletter, sponsoring AA oriented social events, distributing AA literature
				and providing a Hot Line (top right hand corner of this page) for those who need to talk with a helpful member of the aa community.				 
			</p>
		</section>		
		<section>

			<p>We support communication and participation between AA members, groups and districts. 
				Downeast InterGroup serves Area 28&#39;s District 3, 8, 10, 11, 16, 18, 21 and 25. 
				These districts cover most of Maine&#39;s Hancock, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Washington and Waldo Counties.

		<h2>Anaul AA Convention in London, UK</h2>
		<p><strong>Invitation from the London Convention Committee</strong><br/>
		Please find attached our flyer for next year’s convention at the Tower Hotel London, UK. This 
		<a href="https://londonaaconvention.com/" target="_blank">website link</a> will take you to the 
		hotel and event registration, plus the itinerary.</p>
		<p>The hotel booking is open and we encourage early booking because the hotel is likely to fill up with non-AA guests nearer to the event.</p>
		<p>We can confirm that the hotel only charges your card on check-out and that you can cancel (for any reason) up to a week prior to the event.
		We can also confirm that if guidelines due to COVID mean that the event is cancelled or restricted, or that you cannot fly at that time, 
		then your registration fee may be refunded too, and no hotel payments will be taken.</p>
		<p>Nobody really knows yet what the world will look like next spring, but we are ever hopeful that the convention will provide a great opportunity to all meet up once again, and for the first time at this stunning location, right next to Tower Bridge, on the river Thames. 
		This is the very first year we are holding this particular International event and work on it was well underway in March when the current crisis suddenly hit us all!
		The convention is supported jointly by both London Alcoholics Anonymous Regions (UK)  and we are very much looking forward to a fantastic celebration of sobriety and freedom next spring.</p>
		<p>Please pass on to your service officers, sponsees and networks. We look forward to seeing many of you there!</p>
		Yours in fellowship,<br/>Richard F (London convention committee)<br/>

			<h2>The AA Preamble</h2>
			<p>
				ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that
				they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.
				There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect,
				denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy;
				neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
